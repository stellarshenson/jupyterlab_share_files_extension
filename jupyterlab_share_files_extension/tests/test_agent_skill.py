"""The agent skill installed by the wheel is the one in the repository.

The skill ships twice: the repository copy an agent reads from a clone, and the copy
the wheel's shared-data mapping puts under `sys.prefix`. Two copies drift, so they are
compared byte for byte. This fails when the mapping is absent from `pyproject.toml`,
when the installed copy is older than the repository copy, and when the skill is
renamed on one side only.
